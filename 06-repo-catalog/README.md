# 📦 06 · Hackathon Repo Catalog

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

> 🟢 **In plain English:** a shopping list of free, ready-made code (from GitHub) you can use so you don't build everything from scratch. **Just read the "default hackathon kit" table below.** It's the short list that covers most projects. Everything else is for browsing later.
>
> **The index:** the default kit, what changed in 2025–26, and the avoid list. The **298 high-star, actively maintained GitHub repos** that speed up a hackathon, are split into each folder's `docs/repos.md` (see "Browse by folder"). There are also **18 popular ones to avoid**. Every star count, last-push date, license and archive status comes from the GitHub API (2026-09-22).
> Evidence: [`../_research/technical-hackathon-github-repos-2026-09-21/research.md`](../_research/technical-hackathon-github-repos-2026-09-21/research.md)

**Status legend:** ✅ pushed in the last 6 months · ⚠️ slowing, maintenance mode or caution (see note) · ❌ in the Avoid table. Stars are a popularity signal, not a quality guarantee: check the license and last push before building on anything.

## 🧰 The default hackathon kit (start here)

**Cost tags:** 🆓 free / open source · 🆓* free tier (account or limits) · 💳 trial credits only · 💰 paid. Details and a full $0 stack: [`free-ai-dev-tools.md`](../05-tools-and-mcp/docs/free-ai-dev-tools.md)

These picks are a **judgement call** based on verified activity, stars and fit with this toolkit's stack (Next.js 16 + Supabase). Everything else is in the tables below.

## 🔬 Method and caveats

- **Discovery:** 4 parallel researchers (frontend, backend, data/ML, force-multipliers) used 2025–26 sources: Best of JS Rising Stars, GitHub ranking lists, star-history, vendor docs and comparison articles.
- **Verification:** all 280 candidate slugs were checked in batches through the GitHub search API, with renamed repos resolved individually (2026-09-22). Repos whose slug resolved to the wrong project were excluded (for example oRPC's redirect).
- **Not covered:** stars are not a quality score, and a very large star count can reflect hype (some Claude Code skill repos have 100k–290k stars). "Hackathon use" lines are researcher summaries. The status notes come from the findings table above, and some are lower confidence (F4, F17).
- **Freshness:** star counts and push dates go stale within weeks. Re-run with `/bmad-deep-recon` → **Refresh** on the research folder.
